# Active-Noise-Cancellation-ANC-using-LMS-Least-Mean-Square-algorithm
Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) project using the Least Mean Square (LMS) adaptive algorithm. Demonstrates how noise can be suppressed by continuously updating filter coefficients. Includes simulations, adjustable parameters, and visual results for learning adaptive digital signal processing.
